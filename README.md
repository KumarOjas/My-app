# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment



Task Manager App
A simple React-based Task Manager app integrated with Firebase Firestore for managing tasks.

Features
Add tasks to Firestore.
Display tasks from Firestore.
Real-time task updates (optional with Firestore listeners).
Prerequisites
Node.js: Download and install.
Firebase Project: Create a Firebase project (instructions).
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Configure Firebase
Create a firebase.js file in the src folder:
javascript
Copy code
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
Replace the placeholders (YOUR_API_KEY, etc.) with your Firebase configuration details from the Firebase Console.
4. Set Up Firestore
Go to the Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Create Database.
Start in Test Mode for development.
Create a collection named tasks.
Running the App
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Firestore Security Rules
For development, use these Firestore rules:

javascript
Copy code
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tasks/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Public read/write access
    }
  }
}
For production, update rules to restrict access.

Project Structure
